# Responsive search menu experiment

## Why

This was an idea I had after reading [Ethan Marcotte's Responsive Design: Patterns & Principles](abookapart.com/products/responsive-design-patterns-principles).

## What

The idea is to create a menu that works at all screen sizes, browser support etc. Once the menu is open the user is able to use the sites search functionality to filter the navigation.

## Bugs

Feel free to raise any issues etc, this has not been tested at all really.

## Running etc

To build the site:
```
npm install
make build
```

To serve(localhost:8080):
```
make serve
```
